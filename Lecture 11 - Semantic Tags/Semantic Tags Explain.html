    <h1>Semantic Tags in HTML</h1>
    <p>A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.</p>
    <p>By adding semantic HTML tags to your pages, you provide additional information that helps define the roles and relative importance of the different parts of your page.</p>
    <h2>What Are Semantic HTML Tags?</h2>
    <p>Semantic HTML tags are tags that define the meaning of the content they contain.</p> 
    <p>For example, tags like &lt;header&gt;, &lt;article&gt;, and &lt;footer&gt; are semantic HTML tags. They clearly indicate the role of the content they contain.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, tags like &lt;div&gt; and &lt;span&gt; are typical examples of non-semantic HTML elements. They serve only as content holders but give no indication as to what type of content they contain or what role that content plays on the page.</p>
    <h2>Why Do I Need to Use Semantic HTML Tags?</h2>
    <p>Besides the obvious reason that semantic HTML tags are easier to read and understand—for example, by web developers reviewing the code—there are two more specific reasons why you should always use semantic tags.</p>
    <h3>Accessibility</h3>
    <p>For sighted users, it’s easy to identify the various parts of a webpage. Headers, footers, and the main content are all immediately visually apparent.</p> 
    <p>However, it is not that easy for users who are blind or visually impaired and rely on screen readers.</p> 
    <p>The proper use of HTML semantic tags will allow these readers to understand your content better because their screen readers will communicate your content more accurately.</p>
    <h3>SEO</h3>
    <p>Semantic HTML tags are important for SEO (search engine optimization) because they indicate the role of the content within the tags.</p> 
    <p>That information gives search engine crawlers, like Googlebot, a better understanding of your content. This increases the chances that your content will be selected as a candidate for ranking on the search engine results page (SERP) for relevant keywords.</p>
    <p>To put it simply, pages with correctly implemented semantic HTML have an advantage in SEO over those that don’t.</p> 
    <p>You can use a tool like Site Audit to find HTML tag issues that may be affecting your SEO.</p>
