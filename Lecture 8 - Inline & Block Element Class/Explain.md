## Block-level Elements
A block-level element always starts on a new line, and the browsers automatically add some space (a margin) before and after the element.

> A block-level element always takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).

Two commonly used block elements are: <p> and <div>.
        - The <p> element defines a paragraph in an HTML document.

        - The <div> element defines a division or a section in an HTML document.

1. The <p> element is a block-level element.
2. The <div> element is a block-level element.
***Example***
    `<p>Hello World</p>`
    `<div>Hello World</div>`



## Inline Elements*
An inline element does not start on a new line.

> An inline element only takes up as much width as necessary.

This is a <span> element inside a paragraph.
